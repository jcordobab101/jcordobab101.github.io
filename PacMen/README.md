# PacMen Exercise

# Created by:

1. Dr. Williams
2. Joshua Cordoba

# Description:

The Pac-man character was originated back to the end of 1979 but not released until May 1980.
My first interaction with this game or character was back in 1994 when I was 7 years old.
In this exercise, we will create one or many of the Pac-man characters, and once we start the game,
the Pac-man will move at random speeds across the screen.

#### How to Run :

1. Fork this project to your Github page or clone a copy to your local repository.

2. Open the index.html in your browser or use live server extension from cs code for a better experience.

#### Roadmap:

1. The next version of the PacMen exercise will allow the character not only to move and bounce but to attempt to eat a target.
