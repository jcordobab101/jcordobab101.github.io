# Description:

The Real-Time Bus Tracker it's another great exercise that displays the power of the DOM and JavaScript.
We are using a massive amount of data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to target all bus stops between MIT and Harvard universities.
Additionally, we are using API from Map box which is an open-source platform that allows you to create maps on a webpage.

#### How to Run :

1. Fork this project to your Github page or clone a copy to your local repository.

2. Open the index.html in your browser or use live server extension from cs code for a better experience.

3. Press the button "Show stops between MIT and Hardvard.

4. You will see the target moving across the map which simulates the bus route stops.

#### Roadmap:

1. The next version of the Real Time Bus tracker will show more routes and I will start researching about the train schedules.
