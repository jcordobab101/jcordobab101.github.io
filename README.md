# Joshua Cordoba Portfolio

Hello world!

Welcome to my portfolio. This page is still on state of the art and as I learn more from my current MITxPro certification,
I'll keep improving it.

#### Current Projects :

I have 3 live projects which will go over the different usages of JavaScript and the DOM.

1. PacMen Exercise
2. Eyes Exercise
3. Real Time Bus Tracker

# Other Live projects:

I developed and host https://mj-social.com which is my personal private social network.
Most of the foundational code has been contributed by open-source with a lot of my customizations.
Feel free to sign up with Google, Facebook or Twitter.

#### Support:

Please reach me out if you have any suggestions about my site.
